# Open Price Data 📊💰🛒

![Open Price Data Logo](/public/header_preview.png)

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: What's the purpose of open price data?**  
A: I'm aiming to provide a more accurate, crowdsourced, uncorruptable record of real current and historical prices - fueled by contributions on products we actually buy. Ever noticed that the change in your gas or grocery bill doesn't match the government-reported inflation rate? Let's see how this experiment plays out!

**Q: Do I need an account to use this site?**  
A: Nope! No account is needed to browse, but you'll need one to contribute data (to prevent spam and abuse).

**Q: How is Open Price Data 'open'?**  
A: It's open for anyone to see and contribute, and the core website code is open source (you are here!)
