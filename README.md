# Open Prices 📊💰🛒

![Site Preview](/public/header_preview.png)

Open Prices is a crowdsourced platform for tracking real-world prices of everyday products. The goal is to provide a more accurate, transparent, and uncorruptible record of current and historical prices. Right now the focus is grocery (and soon restaurant) prices.

This is a new project under early development, being built in public, to the point I'm embarrassed about being vulnerable by showing it.

## 🤔 FAQ

**Q: What's the purpose of open prices?**  
A: I'm aiming to provide a more accurate, crowdsourced, uncorruptable record of real current and historical prices - fueled by contributions on products we actually buy. Ever noticed that the change in your gas or grocery bill doesn't match the government-reported inflation rate? Let's see how this experiment plays out!

**Q: Do I need an account to use this site?**  
A: Nope! No account is needed to browse, but you'll need one to contribute data (to prevent spam and abuse).

**Q: How is Open Prices 'open'?**  
A: It's open for anyone to see and contribute, and my hope is also to open source future stable services the website will use, so if I develop a budgeting tool for example people can just run that locally/independently. For the moment, the core website code is open source (you are here!)
